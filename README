              [ http requests sniffer for fun and privacy ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

urlgulp started as a quick hack to keep an eye on network activity from
such moderately trusted entities as browsers. It is basically an http
sniffer with some dns and tcp capabilities added.

After each round of capturing requests from the network, it gives
a quick and easy to read summary of contacted hosts, together with
associated requests. It also highlights potential privacy issues and
unwanted traffic:
 - third party domains involved (red, evil)
 - referer leaked to outside domain
 - dns aliases to other domains
 - non http connections (host:port is shown)

features include:
 - folding of similar requests (images, css) to keep things short
 - pretty printing of urls (coloring based on file types, truncating)
 - dns requests summary
 - user agent display
 - and other goodies ...


[ limitations ]

It's currently well suited for use on a single computer where traffic can be
kept to a minimum, so that requests from different sources don't get
mixed up together. Support for filtering / monitoring different sources may
come one day.

Content of ssl traffic isn't known, so no urls there (connection will show
up as host:https)


[ installation ]

- dependencies: perl, tcpdump, urlsnarf (dsniff package)
- run as root.


[ usage ]

Usage: urlgulp [options] [-i interface]

display mode:
  -k            wait for key press to display (default).
  -f            display every interval seconds.
  -w            display after interval seconds of silence.

other options:
  -d <interval> set display interval for -f and -w (default: 5s).
  -u            show user agent used for each request.
  -l            show legend.
  -q            quiet mode. Don't log urls, only domains.
  -r            raw url mode. just dump it all, no url coloring, grouping or truncating.
  -v            be verbose. (use twice for more).
  -g js,img,css specify the set of url types affected by grouping.
  -g all        shortcut for -g img,js,css.
  -g none       disable grouping.
  --tcp-only    track tcp connections only (no urls)
                will show which IP addresses are actually being contacted,
                useful to check whether a remote proxy is really being used or not.
  --warn-ok     allow grouping of urls with warnings (ref, post)
  --req-order   order hosts as they were first requested.
                (default: hosts in domain first, third party last)
  --version     show version.
