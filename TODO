--------------------------------=:[ TODO ]:=---------------------------------


---=:[ README ]:=------------------------------------------------------------

- add examples


---=:[ main ]:=--------------------------------------------------------------

- try under windows

- use different color for tcp port display

display header:
- show number of requests
- display time
- global bandwidth usage per interval

type in commands at run time to change settings!
- stop cmd in particular,
- remember last round

folding:
- group identical urls!
- group arbitrary extensions ?
- option to group urls which differ only in tail ?
- rename grouping -> folding

user agent:
- by default show user agent sticking out
- option to filter out one user agent

- dump mode: kinda what debug mode does now
- url display:
  --dont-truncate (or set number of columns)
  --no-colors
  --no-url-header ?
- keep raw mode then ?
  equiv --no-colors --dont-truncate --no-url-header ?

- doc

- check how ajax shows up


---=:[ serious fun ]:=-------------------------------------------------------

- display traffic for different user agents separately ?

- network mode ! use urlsnarf src ip etc
  - option to select src ip to monitor
  - show different ips talking,
    select which one to display at run time

- column display for different agents/ips ?
  now this is getting seriously silly...

- file mode -> way to use tcpdump capture file as input ?
  possible but will have to rewrite timing logic.
  possible workaround in the meantime:
    if there's a way to "replay" a capture file and get the same output and
    timing tcpdump would have produced, then we can use that instead of live
    capture ...


---=:[ low prio ]:=----------------------------------------------------------

- provide a way to run as normal user ?
    sudo urlcap | urlgulp -i -

- option to disable grouping on urls with tails.
- option to select url truncating logic
- option to set group_really_long_urls and really_long_thres.

- handle / ignore reverse dns lookups ? (ping)

- Don't completely trust CNAME records for finding DNS aliases,
  use wildly different ip adr for host in same domain as indicator ?

- load/save dns tables so we can restart easily without losing dns cache ?


---=:[ fixme ]:=-------------------------------------------------------------

- fix empty user agent display with https

- fix host highlighting for ip adresses, make all bold

- finish debug mode, (non http)

- getting very different results using some DNS servers
  wired.com, not even finding aliases with orange,
  reverse lookup not even working there !
  Do some checks on startup ?

- fix warnings

- fails to highlight file:
ref!                [..]MRT/jview/42976713/direct;vt.1;wi.300;hi.600/


---=:[ pipedream ]:=---------------------------------------------------------

- bandwidth usage for each resource
  -> can check caching
- ssl traffic
- cookies, *especially* 3rd party.
- detect web bugs ?
- display proxy for proxied requests ?
- display params for POST
- gui frontend ?
