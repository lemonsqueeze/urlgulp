--------------------------------------------
README:

- typical use, how it works
- limitations:
  how "main" url is determined
  intermingled of traffic (different hosts, browsers, simul requests)
  ssl, 
  stuff it can't see (cookies etc)
  live capture only
  
- examples
- pretty: use bold, or pictures ?

--------------------------------------------
main:

- sort domains
- group identical urls!
- option to group urls which differ only in tail ?

- rename grouping -> folding
- dump mode: kinda what debug mode does now
- url display:
  --dont-truncate (or set number of columns)
  --no-colors
  --no-url-header ?
- keep raw mode then ?
  equiv --no-colors --dont-truncate --no-url-header ?

- by default show user agent sticking out

- display time
- global bandwidth usage per interval

- doc

---------------------------------------------------
serious fun:

- type in commands at run time to change settings!

- option to filter out one user agent
- display traffic for different user agents separately ?

- network mode ! use urlsnarf src ip etc
  - option to select src ip to monitor
  - show different ips talking,
    select which one to display at run time

- column display for different agents/ips ?
  now this is getting seriously silly...

- file mode -> way to use tcpdump capture file as input ?
  possible but will have to rewrite timing logic.
  possible workaround in the meantime:
    if there's a way to "replay" a capture file and get the same output and
    timing tcpdump would have produced, then we can use that instead of live
    capture ...

---------------------------------------------------
low prio:

- option to disable grouping on urls with tails.
- option to select url truncating logic ?
- option to set group_really_long_urls and really_long_thres.

- handle / ignore reverse dns lookups ? (ping)

- provide a way to run as normal user ?
    sudo urlcap | urlgulp -i -

- Don't completely trust CNAME records for finding DNS aliases,
  use wildly different ip adr for host in same domain as indicator ?

- load/save dns tables so we can restart easily without losing dns cache ?

-----------------------------------------------------------
fixme:

- handle to SIGWINCH

- finish debug mode, (non http)

- check how ajax shows up

- getting very different results using orange DNS and opendns,
  (wired.com, not even finding aliases with orange!)
  (reverse lookup not even working with orange !!)
  Do some checks on startup ?

- fix warnings

- fails to highlight file:
ref!                [..]MRT/jview/42976713/direct;vt.1;wi.300;hi.600/

------------------------------------------------------------
hard: (rewrite)

- bandwidth usage for each resource
  -> can check caching
- ssl traffic
- cookies, *especially* 3rd party.
- detect tracking pictures ?
- display proxy for proxied requests ?
- display params for POST
- gui frontend ?
