TODO

- display useragent
- global bandwidth usage per interval !
- doc

- getting very different results using orange DNS and opendns,
  (wired.com, not even finding aliases with orange!)
  (reverse lookup not even working with orange !!)
  Do some checks on startup ?

- Don't completely trust CNAME records for finding DNS aliases,
  use wildly different ip adr for host in same domain as indicator ?

- finish debug mode, only printing dns stuff right now

- check how ajax shows up
- load/save dns tables so we can restart easily ?

--------------------------

hard: (rewrite)
- bandwidth usage for each resource
  -> can check caching
- ssl traffic
- cookies, *especially* 3rd party.
- detect tracking pictures ?
- display proxy for proxied requests ?
- display params for POST



----------------------
DONE

- key mode: wait for key press to display.
- command line options:
  -d delay
- different interval logic:
  - either strict time intervals like now
  - or timeout after nothing happens
- show number of dns requests
  -> can check if caching works
- command line options:
  -i iface
- handle/display referrer ?
- look for suspiciously long urls, whether in images, css etc
