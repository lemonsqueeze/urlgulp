TODO

- option to set group_really_long_urls and really_long_thres.
- show time
- provide a way to run as normal user ?
    sudo urlcap | urlgulp -i -
- option to disable grouping
- option to select url truncating logic ?
- global bandwidth usage per interval
- doc

- Don't completely trust CNAME records for finding DNS aliases,
  use wildly different ip adr for host in same domain as indicator ?

- load/save dns tables so we can restart easily without losing dns cache ?

- file mode -> way to use tcpdump capture file as input ?
  possible but will have to rewrite timing logic.
  possible workaround in the meantime:
    if there's a way to "replay" a capture file and get the same output and
    timing tcpdump would have produced, then we can use that instead of live
    capture ...

-----------------------------------------------------------
Fixme!

- react to SIGWINCH

- finish debug mode, only printing dns stuff right now

- check how ajax shows up

- getting very different results using orange DNS and opendns,
  (wired.com, not even finding aliases with orange!)
  (reverse lookup not even working with orange !!)
  Do some checks on startup ?

------------------------------------------------------------
hard (rewrite)

- bandwidth usage for each resource
  -> can check caching
- ssl traffic
- cookies, *especially* 3rd party.
- detect tracking pictures ?
- display proxy for proxied requests ?
- display params for POST
